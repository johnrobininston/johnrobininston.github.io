<div class="h1">Thanks for visiting!</div>

I am a 4th year doctoral candidate in the [Statistics and Applied Probability Department](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu) at the University of California Santa Barbara.  I am a member of the Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research (CFMAR) and the Simulation and Control in Finance and Insurance (SCiFI) research group under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Ludkovski](https://ludkovski.pstat.ucsb.edu).

My research interests lie in the interface of Financial Mathematics, Stochastic Games, Deep Learning and Groundwater Markets. For my thesis project I am investigating the use of stochastic games to model groundwater markets in Calfornia.  

I am a recipient of the [Amazon Fellowship](https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/amazon-gift-supports-studies-in-responsible-ai-at-university-of-california-santa-barbara) supporting studies in responsible AI and a mentor in the [PALilSaDs program](https://www.paliisads.org/home) which aims to increase degree completion for low-income, high-achieving STEM undergraduates

If you would like to reach out to discuss any of my written work or my research topics please send me a note using the contact page.

## About me

I am passionate about learning and teaching topics in mathematics, statistics, finance and data science. I am a staunch advocate for open collaboration in academia.  I enjoy writing blog posts about topics I find interesting and am committed to sharing my project work and course material.

In addition to the posts on my website I will also be posting the same content to my profile on Medium, as well as (hopefully) publishing content on YouTube aiming to provide advice and helpful content for students in STEM.

## Education Timeline

:::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-7}

- In 2013 I commenced my undergraduate study at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) studying Theoretical Physics with Mathematics.

  - Between 2014 and 2016 I changed course twice, first to Mechanical Engineering and then to Mathematics with Statistics.

  - I was excluded from university due to poor academic performance but was allowed to return due to mitigating circumstances.

  - I graduated in 2018 with a First Class (Honors) BSc in Mathematics with Statistics.

- During the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 I returned to Lancaster to obtain my MSc in Quantitative Finance, graduating in 2021 summa cum laude with distinction.

- In 2022 I began working towards my doctorate in Statistics and Applied Probability at UC Santa Barbara in California.

  - In 2025 I advanced to candidacy under the supervision of my committee of [Prof. Mike Ludkovski](https://ludkovski.pstat.ucsb.edu), [Prof. Jean-Pierre Fouque](https://fouque.faculty.pstat.ucsb.edu) and [Prof. Ruimeng Hu](https://sites.google.com/site/ruimenghu1/).
