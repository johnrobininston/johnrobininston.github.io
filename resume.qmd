## Professional Profile

Third year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability at the University of
California Santa Barbara. Graduate of Lancaster University with a MSc in Quantitative Finance and a
BSc in Mathematics with Statistics.

## Research Interests

My research interests are orientated broadly towards financial mathematics, environmental science and
computational statistics with a specific focus on the stochastic management of energy markets and natural
resources. Currently, I am conducting research into the multi-period stochastic mangement of California
ground water resources under the supervision of Dr Michael Ludkovski.
