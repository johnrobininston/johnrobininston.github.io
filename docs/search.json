We investigate the underlying properties of the time series data, the suitability of SARIMA models, and whether the forecasts they produce accurately capture future observations. Throughout the project we implement various univariate time series analysis techniques including exploratory analysis, model selection procedures based on the adjusted Akaike Information Criteria, diagnostic checking, residual analysis and spectral analysis. Our first choice \\(\\text{SARIMA}(0,1,3)(0,1,1)_{12}\\) model performed well, producing approximately Gaussian WN residuals and accurate forecasts with confidence intervals capturing the true observed future values of the time series."

    "text": "Introduction\nSeveral geophysical time series contain seasonal variation with one key example being carbon dioxide (CO\\(_2\\)) atmospheric concentration which typically is known to have annual seasonality - largely due to plant photosynthesis and respiration - superimposed upon an increasing trend caused primarily by human CO\\(_2\\) production. In this project we examine a data set consisting of monthly measurements of atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) above Mauna Lao, Hawaii in the 32 year period from between 1959 and 1990 with the aim of producing accurate forecasts - in our case a 5 year ahead forecast - by fitting a suitable model from the SARIMA model family. We use a variety of time series analysis including exploratory analysis (time series decomposition, stationarity transformations, inspecting series autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations, tests for normality, stationarity and autocorrelation), SARIMA fitting and model selection (checking for stationarity and invertibility, coefficient significance testing, performance criteria) and residual analysis (portmanteau tests, residual WN tests, model spectral decomposition). We find that the \\(\\text{SARIMA}(0,1,3)(0,1,1)_{12}\\) model is our optimal model candidate and our subsequent residual analysis, forecasting and spectral decomposition indicates that our model produces accurate forecasts which captured the future true observations of the time series. Our analysis was performed using the programming language R and a full breakdown of our code can be found in the corresponding GitHub repository."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model developed by the economists Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton which is widely used in the pricing of options contacts. The model assumes that the price of heavily traded assets follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility. When applied to a stock option, the model incorporates the constant price variation of the stock, the time value of money, the option’s strike price, and the time to the option’s expiry.\nThe Vasicek model is a mathematical model used in financial economics to estimate potential pathways for future interest rate changes. The model states that the movement of interest rates is affected only by random (stochastic) market movements and models interest rate movements as a factor composed of market risk, time, and equilibrium value - where the rate tends to revert towards the mean of those factors over time.\nWe will first investigate how the price of a European call option - as given by the Black- Scholes model - varies with changes in time, interest rates, strike price and volatility. We will then simulate an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and use this to simulate the price of a bond - using the Vasicek model - over a given time period before evaluating the distribution of the simulated prices.\nWe conduct this project using the programming language R along with the ggplot2, reshape, tidyr and gridExtra packages.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reshape)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'tidyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:reshape':\n\n    expand, smiths\n\nlibrary(gridExtra)"

    "section": "Data",
    "text": "Data\n\nData Description\nOur data set contains monthly measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide above Mauna Loa, Hawaii from January 1959 to December 1990, measured in parts per million (ppm). The data was originally collected from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, La Jolla, California and made readily available through the tsdlpackage developed by Rob Hyndman, Professor of Statistics at Monash University, Australia. The data set initially contained missing values which were subsequently filled in by linear interpolation. Our raw data series, labelled by \\(x_t\\), \\(t = 1, ..., 384\\) contains 384 observations.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\nWe split our data into disjoint training and testing sets, with the latter containing the last 5 years of observed CO\\(_2\\) levels to be used to analyse the performance of the foreacsts produced by our chosen final model. Our training data set contains 324 observations whilst our testing data set contains 60. Using the training data we produce a time series plot, shown below in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Atmospheric carbon dioxide above Mauna Loa, Hawaii.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see clear evidence of both an increasing polynomial trend and a seasonal component (with a 12 month period) implying that our raw data is non-stationary. The variance of our data appears constant and there is no evidence of sharp changes in behaviour indicating that a SARIMA model will likely suit our data well. We decompose the time series in Figure 2 below to provide a clearer picture of the seasonal and trend components and since we observe no evidence of heteroscedastic behaviour in the residuals we opt not to transform our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Time Series Decomposition\n\n\n\n\n\nWe produce a plot of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the data, shown below in Figure 3, from which we see highly significant autocorrelations for all lags up to 40 which slowly decay and show seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: ACF and PACF of raw data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe attempt to obtain stationarity by differencing, first with lag 12 to remove the seasonal trend. Mathematically this transformation is denoted:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{1}\ny_t = x_t−x_{t−12} = (1−B^{12})x_t = ∇_{12}x_t,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(y_t\\) is our seasonally differenced data series and B is the back-shift operator whereby \\(B^kx_t = x_{t−k}\\). A time series plot of our differenced data is shown below in Figure 4 along with a trend line, from which we can see that all evidence of a seasonal trend has been removed but the data appears to still be non-stationary as a linear trend is still present. Alongside we include the ACF plot of our seasonally differenced data from which we see the decaying autocorrelation typical of data with a polynomial trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Time series plot, ACF and PACF of seasonally differenced data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe therefore difference again with lag 1 to remove the linear trend from in the data, denoted mathematically by:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\\tag{2}\nu_t = y_t−y_{t−1} = (1−B)y_t = (1−B)(1−B^{12})x_t = ∇_1∇_{12}x_t.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(u_t\\) is our twice differenced data. We produce another time series plot of our twice differenced data below in Figure 6."
