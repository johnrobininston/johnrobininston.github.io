We investigate the underlying properties of the time series data, the suitability of SARIMA models, and whether the forecasts they produce accurately capture future observations. Throughout the project we implement various univariate time series analysis techniques including exploratory analysis, model selection procedures based on the adjusted Akaike Information Criteria, diagnostic checking, residual analysis and spectral analysis. Our first choice \\(\\text{SARIMA}(0,1,3)(0,1,1)_{12}\\) model performed well, producing approximately Gaussian WN residuals and accurate forecasts with confidence intervals capturing the true observed future values of the time series."
