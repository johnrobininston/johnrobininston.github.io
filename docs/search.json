I am a member of the Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research (CFMAR) and the Simulation and Control in Finance and Insurance (SCiFI) research group under the supervision of Prof. Michael Ludkovski.\nMy research interests lie in the interface of Financial Mathematics, Stochastic Games, Deep Learning and Groundwater Markets. For my thesis project I am investigating the use of stochastic games to model groundwater markets in Calfornia.\nI am a recipient of the Amazon Fellowship supporting studies in responsible AI and a mentor in the PALilSaDs program which aims to increase degree completion for low-income, high-achieving STEM undergraduates\nIf you would like to reach out to discuss any of my written work or my research topics please send me a note using the contact page."
