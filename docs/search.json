    "text": "✏️ Information\nWelcome to Data Science with R where we outline a course of study for understanding how to use the programming language R for data science and statistical modelling.\nThe aim of this course is to provide a thorough introduction to programming in R for individuals who may have never programmed before. First, we outline how to install R on our operating system, how to download and use an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) such as RStudio, Positron or VSCode, and how to install packages on our system. We will then explore various ways to explore, manage and analyze data using both the in-built functionality in R as well as available libraries such as tidyverse."
