    "text": "✏️ Information\nWelcome to Data Science with R where we outline a course of study for understanding how to use the programming language R for data science and statistical modelling.\nThe aim of this course is to provide a thorough introduction to programming in R for individuals who may have never programmed before. First, we outline how to install R on our operating system, how to download and use an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) such as RStudio, Positron or VSCode, and how to install packages on our system. We will then explore various ways to explore, manage and analyze data using both the in-built functionality in R as well as available libraries such as tidyverse."

    "text": "MC Classification\n\nState Classification\nWe can classify MC states based on how they appear in the chain and their behavior in the limit. States can be persistent (recurrent), null-persistent, transient, absorbing, periodic and ergodic.\n\nDefinition: (Persistent States) A state \\(j\\) is persistent if the probability that the process will return to \\(j\\) given that it started at \\(j\\) eventually is 1, that is \\[\\mathbb{P}(X_{n}=j~\\text{for some}~n\\geq 1|X_{0}=j)=1.\\]\n\nA sub-class of persistent states are null-persistent states which are persistent thats that have an infinite mean recurrence time. States that are not null-persistent are said to be positive_persistent.\nFor example, consider a symmetric random walk. Any point in the state space is null-persistent since the random walk can always return but may take infinitely long to do so. We discuss null-persistent states in a later note on MCs.\n\nDefinition: (Transient States)\nAlternatively, if a state \\(j\\) is not persistent it must be transient, that is, the probability that the process will return to \\(j\\) given that it started at \\(j\\) eventually is 0 i.e. the processes structure prevents it from returning. This is equivalent to writing \\[\\mathbb{P}(X_{n}=i~\\text{for some}~n\\geq 1|X_{0}=i)&lt;1.\\]\n\n\nDefinition: (Periodic States)\nThe period of a state \\(j\\) is the greatest common divider of all \\(n\\) for which \\(p_{{i,i}}(n)&gt;0\\) i.e.  \\[d(i)=gcd\\{n:p_{i,i}(n)&gt;0\\}.\\] If \\(d(i)=1\\) then the state \\(j\\) is aperiodic and otherwise, the state is said to be periodic.\n\n\nDefinition: (Ergodic)\nA state \\(j\\) is ergodic if it is positive persistent and aperiodic i.e. \\(\\mu_{i,i}&lt;\\infty\\) and \\(d(i)=1\\).\n\n\nDefinition: (Absorbing)\nA state \\(j\\) is absorbing if \\(p_{j,j}=1\\), that is the probability of leaving state \\(j\\) once the process has entered is 0.\n\n\n\nChain Classification\nTo classify chains we first define state communication, that is when paths between states have non-zero probability.\n\nDefinition: (Communicating States)\nFor MC \\(\\{ X_{t} \\}\\) state \\(i\\) communicates with state \\(j\\), denoted \\(i \\to j\\), if \\(p_{i,j}(n)&gt;0\\) for some \\(n\\). If \\(i\\to j\\) and \\(j \\to i\\) we say that \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) intercommunicate, denoted \\(i \\leftrightarrow j\\).\n\nWe can show that intercommunication is an equivalence class and thus can be used to split MC state spaces into communication classes. For \\(i,j\\) in the same communication class we have:\n\nStates \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) have the same period;\nState \\(i\\) is transient iff \\(j\\) is transient; and\nState \\(i\\) is null persistent iff \\(j\\) is.\n\n\nDefinition: (Irreducibility)\nA set of states \\(C\\) is irreducible if for all \\(i,j\\in C\\), \\(i\\leftrightarrow j\\), that is all states within \\(C\\) inter-communicate.\n\n\nDefinition: (Closed)\nA set of states \\(C\\) is closed if for all \\(i \\in C\\), \\(p_{i,j}=0\\) for all \\(j\\not\\in C\\), that is, the chain never leaves \\(C\\) once it has entered. Not that clearly the set consisting of one absorbing state is closed.\n\n\nExample: Consider the MC transition diagram shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\nExample transition probability diagram.\n\n\nWe define \\(S_1:=\\{5\\}\\), \\(S_2:=\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) and \\(S_3:=\\{6,7\\}\\). The chain is clearly reducible since \\(2\\to 5\\) and \\(3\\to 6\\) are one way journies. We can see that \\(5\\) is absorbing since the chain can never leave once it arrives. We see that states \\(1,2,3,4\\) are transient since the chain will visit them and never return at some point, and states \\(6\\) and \\(7\\) are recurrent since the chain will always revisit them. We say that \\(S_1\\) is an closed recurrent (absorbing) class, \\(S_2\\) is a transient class and \\(S_3\\) is a closed recurrent class."

    "text": "Limiting Distributions\n\nLimiting Distribution\nConsider the long-term behavior of a MC \\(\\{ X_{n} \\}_{n=0}^\\infty\\) when \\(n \\to \\infty\\). It is possible for the chain to converge to a particular state (e.g. a Galton-Watson-Bienaymé (GWB) Branching Process can converge to 0). Additionally, it is possible for a MC to converge to some random variable \\(X~a.s.\\) as \\(n\\to \\infty\\). Intuitively, if a Markov chain runs for a long time it generally doesn’t converge because it is always jumping around but its distribution can settle down.\n\nDefinition: (Limiting Distribution) The limiting distribution of a homogenous MC with initial distribution \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) and TP matrix \\(P\\) is the distribution vector \\[\\lambda:=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\mu\\cdot P^n.\\]\n\nThis is often a challenging limit to find analytically and even numerically often requires Monte-Carlo simulations.\n Example: Reconsider our last MC example with transition diagram given in the figure below.\n\n\n\nComplicated transition diagram.\n\n\nWe know that the \\(S_2:=\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) is transient and so given enough time to run, the chain will either end on in \\(S_1=\\{5\\}\\) or \\(S_3=\\{6,7\\}\\). We therefore need to ask the following questions:\n\nHow do we know what proportion of the time the chain ends in each class.\nIf the chain ends up in closed irreducible \\(S_3\\), what is the behavior of the state distribution in the limit? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Stationary Distributions\n\n\n\n\nStationary Distribution\nA process is strictly stationary if its distribution does not change under translations, i.e. over time. More formally we give the following definition.\n\nDefinition: (Strictly Stationary Process)\nA process \\(\\{ X_{n},~n\\geq 0 \\}\\) is strictly stationary if for any integers \\(m\\geq 0\\) and \\(k&gt;0\\), we have \\[(Y_{0}, Y_{1}, \\dots Y_{m})\\stackrel{\\mathcal{D}}{=}(Y_{k}, Y_{k+1}, \\dots, Y_{k+m})\\] that is, the distribution does not change under translations.\n\nThis is often a challenging condition to show and so we also define a weak stationarity of the mean and covariance being invariant to changes in time. See oour discussion of Time Series Anaysis for more detailed noted on stationarity.\n\nDefinition: (Stationary Distribution)\nThe vector \\(\\pi=(\\pi_{j},~j \\in S)\\) is called a stationary distribution of a Markov chain if:\n\n\\(\\pi_{j}\\geq 0\\).\n\\(\\sum_{j\\in S}\\pi_{j}=1\\).\n\\(\\pi=\\pi P\\).\n\n\nNote that (3) can equivalently be written as \\[\n\\pi_{j}=\\sum_{i \\in S}\\pi_{i}p_{i,j}\\text{ for all }j \\in S.\n\\]\nAlso note that \\(\\pi P^2=\\pi P\\cdot P=\\pi P=\\pi\\) and similarly, for all \\(n&gt;1\\), \\(\\pi P^n=\\pi\\), that is \\(\\pi_{j}=\\sum_{i\\in S}\\pi_{i}p_{i,j}(n)\\) for all \\(j \\in S\\).\n\nTheorem: (Stationary Distribution) For any irreducible MC \\(\\{X\\}\\) with a finite state space \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) there exists a stationary distribiton \\(\\pi\\).\n\nProof:\nLet \\(P\\) be the transition matrix on a finite state space \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), and assume the chain is irreducible. In a finite Markov chain, at least one state is recurrent (otherwise all states would be transient, which is impossible in a finite state space because probability mass would have to “escape” forever without accumulating anywhere). Since the chain is irreducible, all states communicate with that recurrent state, hence every state is recurrent.\nBecause the chain is finite and irreducible, starting from any state \\(i\\), every other state \\(j\\) is hit with positive probability in at most \\(|S|-1\\) steps along some path. In particular, there exists an \\(m\\ge 1\\) with \\[\np^{(m)}_{ii} &gt; 0.\n\\]\nLet \\(\\tau_i^+ = \\inf\\{n\\ge1: X_n=i\\}\\) be the first return time to \\(i\\). Then each block of \\(m\\) steps has probability at least \\(p^{(m)}_{ii}\\) of containing a return to \\(i\\) at its endpoint, so \\[\n\\mathbb{P}_i(\\tau_i^+ &gt; km) \\le (1-p^{(m)}_{ii})^k.\n\\]\nHence the tail of \\(\\tau_i^+\\) is geometrically bounded, implying \\[\n\\mathbb{E}_i[\\tau_i^+] &lt; \\infty.\n\\]\nSo the chain is positive recurrent. Define, for each \\(j\\in S\\), \\[\n\\pi_j := \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_i\\!\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\tau_i^+-1}\\mathbf{1}\\{X_n=j\\}\\right]}{\\mathbb{E}_i[\\tau_i^+]}.\n\\]\nThis is the expected fraction of time spent in state \\(j\\) during an \\(i\\to i\\) regeneration cycle. Clearly \\(\\pi_j\\ge 0\\) and \\[\n\\sum_{j\\in S}\\pi_j\n= \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_i\\!\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\tau_i^+-1}\\sum_{j\\in S}\\mathbf{1}\\{X_n=j\\}\\right]}{\\mathbb{E}_i[\\tau_i^+]}\n= \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_i[\\tau_i^+]}{\\mathbb{E}_i[\\tau_i^+]}=1,\n\\]\nso \\(\\pi\\) is a probability distribution. To show \\(\\pi P=\\pi\\), note that the expected number of visits to \\(j\\) during a cycle equals the expected number of transitions into \\(j\\) during the cycle (up to the regeneration boundary, which contributes no net imbalance because the cycle starts and ends at \\(i\\)). Formally, by the Markov property and counting transitions within the cycle, \\[\n\\mathbb{E}_i\\!\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\tau_i^+-1}\\mathbf{1}\\{X_{n+1}=j\\}\\right]\n= \\sum_{k\\in S}\\mathbb{E}_i\\!\\left[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\tau_i^+-1}\\mathbf{1}\\{X_n=k\\}\\right]p_{kj}.\n\\]\nDivide both sides by \\(\\mathbb{E}_i[\\tau_i^+]\\) to get \\[\n\\pi_j = \\sum_{k\\in S}\\pi_k p_{kj},\n\\]\nwhich is exactly \\(\\pi P=\\pi\\). Thus a stationary distribution exists.\n\\(\\square\\)\nExample: Consider a Markov chain describing the meals served by a restaurant with transition graph shown below in Figure 1 provided by helpful video on Markov chains by Normalized Nerd.\n\n\n\nExample transition diagram for a MC describing meals served at a restaurant.\n\n\nTaking state 1 to be hamburger, state 2 to be pizza and state 3 to be hotdog, the transition matrix \\(P\\) can be written as \\[\nP=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.2 & 0.6 & 0.2  \\\\\n0.3 & 0 & 0.7  \\\\\n0.5 & 0 & 0.5\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nGiven the restaurant first serves pizza we can define the initial distribution \\(\\pi_{0}=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\\). Applying the transition matrix \\(P\\) we get \\[\n\\pi_{0}P=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.2 & 0.6 & 0.2  \\\\\n0.3 & 0 & 0.7  \\\\\n0.5 & 0 & 0.5\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.3 & 0 & 0.7\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\pi_{1},\n\\]\nthe second state future transition probabilities. Repeating this step for \\(\\pi_{1}\\) we have \\[\n\\pi_{0}P=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.3 & 0 & 0.7\n\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.2 & 0.6 & 0.2  \\\\\n0.3 & 0 & 0.7  \\\\\n0.5 & 0 & 0.5\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.41 & 0.18 & 0.41\n\\end{bmatrix}=\\pi_{2},\n\\]\nIf a stationary distribution \\(\\pi\\) exists it would mean that as \\(\\pi_{0}, \\pi_{1}, \\dots\\) continues, eventually it will reach a point where it doesn’t change when \\(P\\) is applied, hence using linear algebra we can write the expression \\[\n\\pi P=\\pi,\n\\]\nsee Definition 2 above. Additionally, since \\(\\pi\\) is a vector of probabilities we have that \\(\\pi(1)+\\pi(2)+\\pi(3)=1\\) and solving this system gives the stationary distribution \\[\n\\pi=\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{25}{71} & \\frac{15}{71} & \\frac{31}{71}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can numerically confirm our result by iteratively applying the transition probability matrix: \n\nP = np.array([\n    [.2, .6, .2],\n    [.3, 0, .7],\n    [.5, 0, .5]\n])\npi = np.array([\n    0, 1, 0\n])\npi_list = []\npi_list.append(pi)\n\nn = 50\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    pi = pi @ P\n    pi_list.append(pi) \n\npi_list = np.array(pi_list).squeeze()\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(n+1), pi_list[:,0], color=\"red\", label=\"Hamburger\")\nax.plot(range(n+1), pi_list[:,1], color=\"green\", label=\"Pizza\")\nax.plot(range(n+1), pi_list[:,2], color=\"blue\", label=\"Hotdog\")\n\n\n\n\nTransition probability convergence plot.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: (Doubly Stochastic Matrices)\nA matrix \\(P:=(p_{i,j})_{i,j\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\) is said to be doubly stochastic when both rows and columns sum to 1, that is \\[\n\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_{i,j} = \\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_{i,j}=1.\n\\]\nTheorem: (Uniform Stationary Distributions for Doubly Stochastic MCs)\nA finite state homogenous MC with doubly stochastic transition probability matrix has a uniform stationary distribution.\nProof\nAssume \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) has \\(n\\) elements and define \\(\\pi = (\\pi_i)_{i\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\) where \\(\\pi_i=1/n\\). Then clearly\n\\[\n\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\pi_i p_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{X}}p_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{n} = \\pi_j,\n\\]\nholds for all \\(j\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). Since by definition \\(\\pi\\) is normalized we obtain the result.\n\\(\\square\\)"
