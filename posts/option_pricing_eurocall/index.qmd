## Introduction

In this post we will derive the pricing formula for European call options on a stock with dynamics given by the Black-Scholes model.  We will then construct a real world example, estimating model parameters using historical stock prices and a theoretical option.  

## Problem Outline

Consider the Black-Scholes-Merton model where we consider an economy consisting of a stocke $S$ and a (risk-free) bond $B$ with **Geometric Brownian Motion** dynamics
$$
\begin{cases}
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t \\ 
dB_t = r B_t d
\end{cases}
$$
