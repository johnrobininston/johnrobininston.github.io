## Updates

Over the past few months I have been working to prepare and submit an initial research report as part of my departments qualification requirements.  Thanks to guidance from my supervisor [Dr Ludkovski](https://ludkovski.pstat.ucsb.edu) and helpful discussions with my reviewer [Dr Ichiba](https://ichiba.faculty.pstat.ucsb.edu) I am grateful to say my report has been accepted and I am now qualified to work towards my advancement.

It has been a lot of work these first few years riddled with set backs and challenges but it is rewarding to finally feel confident about my direction moving forward.  I feel more focussed and driven now that I have a clear goal and a project to focus my attention on.

For any graduate student still working towards this milestone just keep moving forward.  I have been overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy and imposter's syndrome being surrounded by so many brilliant and smart students but I have found it more important to maintain a positive work ethic and to embrace doggedly trying to consistently improve.  You might never be the smartest student in the department but you can always strive to be smarter than your past self.
