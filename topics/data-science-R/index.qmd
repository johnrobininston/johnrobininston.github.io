## ✏️ Information

Welcome to **Data Science with `R`** where we outline a course of study for
understanding how to use the programming language `R` for data science and statistical modelling.

The aim of this course is to provide a thorough introduction to programming in R for individuals who may have never programmed before.  First, we outline how to install `R` on our operating system, how to download and use an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) such as `RStudio`, `Positron` or `VSCode`, and how to install packages on our system.  We will then explore various ways to explore, manage and analyze data using both the in-built functionality in `R` as well as available libraries such as `tidyverse`.

## ✍️ Notes

This course is based fundamentally on the PSTAT10 Data Science Principles class I have taught in the past at UCSB.  The course is split into the following topics:

1. Installing and using R and RStudio.

2. Operators, Logic & Data Types.

3. Atomic Data Structures.

4. Dataframes and Lists.

5. Functions.

6. Looping and Branching.

7. Fundamentals of Probability Theory.

8. Simulation and MC Methods.

9. Data Handling with the `tidyverse` package.

10. Plotting with `ggplot2`.

11. SQL Basics.

12. SQL Aggregation and Joins.


## 📚 Materials

Each topic links to a website post with the relevant material.  A pdf copy of the combined course notes can be downloaded here.  Furthermore, each wesite post links to the corresponding youtube video going through the material.

For this course you will need to download the language R, your chosen IDE and Quarto using the following links:
