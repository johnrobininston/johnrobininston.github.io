## ✏️ Information

In this topic we study _discrete time Stochastic Processes_, countable sequences of random variables indexed in time.  The material covered in these notes was prepareed during my time working as a teaching assistant under both Prof. Tomoyuki Ichiba and Prof. Vellaisamy Palaniappan for their respective versions of the PSTAT160A Stochastic Processes course at UC Santa Barbara.

## ✍️ Notes

1. Probability Theory
2. Generating Functions
3. [Markov Chains](../../posts/blog/markov-chains/)
4. Random Walks
5. Branching Processes
6. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Methods
7. Poisson Processes

## 📚 Materials

Below are links to documents I have prepared for my past sections as well as a collection of additional exercise sheets covering similar questions to those covered in past assignments and exams.  These documents can also be found in the respective course pages on my GitHub.
