## Data Science with R

### Course Information

Welcome to my course titled **Data Science with R** which provides an introduction on how to use the programming language `R` for data science and statistical modelling.

The aim of this course is to provide a thorough introduction to programming in R for individuals who may have never written or utilized a programming language before.  First we outline how to install `R` on our operating system, how to download and use an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) such as `RStudio`, `Positron` or `VSCode`, and how to install packages on our system.  We will then explore various ways to explore, manage and analyze data using both the in-built functionality in `R` as well as available libraries such as `tidyverse`.
